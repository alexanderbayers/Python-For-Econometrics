#Exercise 1
#np.log(np.exp(1000)) returns inf, analytically its 1000

#Exercise 2
#Eps/10 is not equal to zero, x = 1 + eps/10 - 1 is equal to zero though

#Exercise 3
#1-eps/10-1 == 0 is True, 1-1+eps/10 == 0 is False
#The two are different because 1-1 translates to 0 first

#Exercise 4
#Yes it is

#Exercise 5
#It is the same.
